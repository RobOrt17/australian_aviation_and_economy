###Executive Summary
The basis for this project is to explore airline data through objective analysis and provide insights on the Australian aviation community. I will be analysing Australian aviation data that spans from the years 1985 through the most current data in 2021. My motive for this project is to transform the dataset and tell a story through data analysis about the impact that the coronavirus had on the aviation community. 

###Motivation
My motivation for this project stems from my extensive career within the aviation community and my love for travel (wanderlust). Now that I have been exposed to data analytics, and have used various technologies in order to transform data and to further tell a story with data, my ways of seeing the aviation community from an analytics decision making point of view will only improve.

###Data Question
What impact did Coronavirus have on Australian aviation? 
Which airport has the greatest impact on Australian aviation?
 
###Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
I will use Microsoft Excel to view spreadsheets and to make minor adjustments, but also utilize Python for further data analysis. For this analysis, I plan to present my dashboard utilizing Tableau’s data visualization tool. I also plan to make a Google Sheets presentation to collectively display my findings. My intended audience for this capstone project is insiders within the aviation community.  

###Data Sources
The source of this dataset comes from the Australian Government's data.gov.au website. Source of data link: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/international-airlines-traffic-by-city-pairs/resource/ebcafd83-9514-4f72-a995-fe7ee90cb9da?view_id=4ad7311e-83a6-49fb-a9f6-9a7215000b30

###Known Issues and Challenges
A few anticipated challenges that may arise with this project are gaps in the dataset. This may prevent me from answering my proposed data question. Being able to provide a geospatial map with Python that will suit my needs in a way that I'm able to show my findings.
